Difference between git vs github
-------------------------------
1. git is a tool                                            -    github is a website (github.com)
2. git is Command line interface(CLI)                       -    github is Graphical user interface(GUI) 
3. we can't view data in bare repo         	           -    but we can view & do all actions in bare repo 
4. bare is bare only here                         	   -    but, bare repo you can convert into non-bare here   
5. here we are creating non-bare by cloning bare repo       -    but, directly we can create/init non-bare                                             
6. local                                           	   -    remotely

git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/VmTutes/hello.git
git push -u origin master

- clone existing repository from github to your local machine 
    >> git clone https://github.com/VmTutes/Vinodh-Machireddy-Tutorials.git

- change some data and add, commit
- git push (or) git push origin master

Managing tags remotely
----------------------
to create tag
  >> git tag <tag_name>

push tags from local repo to github repo
  >> git push origin --tags

to delete tags remotely in github

pull = fetch + merge

fetch :- it just download the changes to local machine but it will not integerate.
